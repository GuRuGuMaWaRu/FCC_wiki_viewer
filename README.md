## Thoughts

Another project that gave me a little pause. I had to think of something cool and fortunately at that time I just found out about material design! I must say my ideas were crazy and far above my skill level, so in the end I scaled them down and created all these paper block and little animations. I was very satisfied with the final result, but as usual my friends weren't that impressed :D
